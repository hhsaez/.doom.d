## Agent Guidelines

- Apply all configuration changes in `config.org`; do not edit `config.el` unless expressly instructed.
- Any new function should be prefixed with `hhsaez/` (not `my/`). 
- Always ensure the README.md file has all required steps to correctly setup DOOM Emacs in the current environment, specially any custom command and/or manual process needed beyond `doom sync`.
